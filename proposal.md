# Mod 7 Project

Created by Abdullah Khan, and Chris Jimenez.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, is for Pokemon enjoyers. It allows users to search for pokemon and add it to their team.

## API & React Router

This application will use the Pokemon API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: (PokeApi)(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/)
- (Pokemon)(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/{id or name}/)
  - List of pokemon
  - For each pokemon I want the `type`, and `moves`
- (Pokedex-Entres)(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/${pokemonNum}/)
  - Pokedex entries
  - From this we can get the pokemon genus and a short synopsis of the pokemon.
- (Pokemon sprites)(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/${pokemon-id}.png)
  - Sprites of pokemon

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

- On the `/home` page, users can see several popular pokemon characters
- On the `/search` page, users can search for a specific character and click on the character to view their information
- On the `/team` builder page, users can see a search form where they can add pokemon and builder their own team.

## ü§î Stretch User Stories

If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:

- use a soundboard to add pokemon cries to the website
- Able to make their own pokemon and add it to the website
- Users will see animations gifs of characters

## üìÜ Timeline for reaching MVP in 1 week

To ensure that we can complete all core features of the application in 1 week, we will aim to complete tasks according to the following timeline:

**Day 1**

- [ ] Research the api further
- [ ] Render a list of characters in any order
- [ ] Work on nav bar
- [ ] Used Context at least once
- [ ] Used Vite for this project
- [ ] Used React
- [ ] Made a fetch to get multiple resources
- [ ] Created at least 3 components
- [ ] Have all components in their own files (1 export per file)
      [ ] There is a `main` element on _each_ page
- [ ] There is a `nav` element on _each_ page
- [ ] The `nav` contains a `ul` of links
- [ ] At least one `h1` element on _each_ page

- [ ] All colors have a AAA difference
  - https://color.a11y.com can check your site for you!
- [ ] All buttons look like buttons, all links look like links
- [ ] Made a fetch to get a single, specific resource
- [ ] Made a third fetch for whatever you want
- [ ] Passed props to a component at least 3 times
  - [ ] 1st check box
  - [ ] 2nd check box
  - [ ] 3rd check box
- [ ] Used the `useState` hook at least 3 times
  - [ ] 1st check box
  - [ ] 2nd check box
  - [ ] 3rd check box
- [ ] Used the `useEffect` hook at least 2 times
  - [ ] 1st check box
  - [ ] 2nd check box
- [ ] Used the `useContext` hook at least once

**Day 3** (MVP due by the end of the day)

- [ ] Finish search page
- [ ] Work on team builder page
- [ ] Finish team builder page

- [ ] Demonstrated a working controlled Form
- [ ] Lifted state up out of a component at least once

**Day 5**

- [ ] Navigation bar fits cleanly on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Navigation visually indicates what page you are on
  - Think underlines, bolding, etc. this should change as you move around the site
- [ ] Used Flexbox or Grid to style list of components
