# Mod 7 Project

Created by Abdullah Khan, and Chris Jimenez.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, is for comic enjoyers. It allows users to search for characters in several different comics. Upon loading it will display images if popular comic book characters. If you click on an image it will display info of that character.

## API & React Router

This application will use the Comic Vine API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: (PokeApi)(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/)
- (Pokemon)(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/{id or name}/)
  - List of pokemon
  - For each pokemon I want the `type`, and `moves`
- (Pokedex-Entres)(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/${pokemonNum}/)
  - Pokedex entries
  - From this we can get the pokemon genus and a short synopsis of the pokemon.
- (Pokemon sprites)(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/${pokemon-id}.png)
  - Sprites of pokemon
