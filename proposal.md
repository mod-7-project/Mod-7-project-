# Mod 7 Project

Created by Abdullah Khan, and Chris Jimenez.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, is for comic enjoyers. It allows users to search for characters in several different comics. Upon loading it will display images if popular comic book characters. If you click on an image it will display info of that character.

## API & React Router

This application will use the Comic Vine API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- [Characters](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/characters/?api_key=95c02d947924126bfffa281819f89edf014a4d7a&format=json)
  - List of characters
  - For each character I want the `name`, `image of character,` and `aliases`
- [API endpoint #2](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/characters/?api_key=95c02d947924126bfffa281819f89edf014a4d7a&format=json)
  - Powers character has
  - Several powers the character has
- [API endpoint #3](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/characters/?api_key=95c02d947924126bfffa281819f89edf014a4d7a&format=json)
